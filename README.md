- **Project description**:  
  This project aims to analyze three datasets to identify potential correlations and trends between different socioeconomic factors. The datasets include:

  - **employment-data**: Covers unemployment rates, employment rates, and activity rates of the active population.  
  - **education-data**: Includes enrollment rates in Basic Vocational Training, Intermediate Vocational Training, and Higher Vocational Training.  
  - **cybercrime-data**: Displays the total number of criminal offenses, cybercrime-related incidents, and arrests or investigations related to cybercrime.  

  The analysis will provide insights into how these factors may be interconnected and their potential social implications.
